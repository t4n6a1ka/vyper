# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Vyper is currently in limited beta.

It is un-audited software, use with caution.

## Audit reports

Vyper has not been audited yet. When an audit is complete, we will list all previous reports here.

<!-- REMOVE WHEN COMPLETE
Vyper is constantly changing and improving.
This means the lastest version available may not be audited.
We try to ensure the highest security code possible, but occasionally things slip through.

At specific releases, we conduct audits with experienced security professionals to ensure that the codebase quality is high,
and that we minimize the chance of critical bugs as much as possible.

Here are the audits we have undergone in the past:

| Audit Date | Auditor | Version | Report Link |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |

Please read prior audit reports for projects that use Vyper here:

<!-- Please use the tagged version if possible, or commit hash if a non-tagged version was used. -->

## Known Vyper Vulnerabilities and Exposures (VVEs)

The following is a list of all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and exposures.
Best Practices dictate that when we are first made aware of a potential vulnerability,
we take the precaution of assessing it's potential impact to deployed projects first.
When we are confident that a disclosure will not impact known projects that use Vyper,
we will add an entry to this table for posterity and reference by others.

<!-- Please use the tagged version if possible, or commit hash if a non-tagged version was used. -->

| VVE | Description | Introduced | Fixed | Report Link |
